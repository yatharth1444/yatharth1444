## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## About-me
I'm working on projects in blockchain, AI, and cybersecurity. Some of the exciting areas I'm building in include Zero-Knowledge Proofs (like zkSync, StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM), smart wallets (ERC-4337), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), and tokenizing real-world assets like real estate and bonds.

I'm also exploring decentralized AI â€“ where AI models run on blockchain and give users more control over their data.

On the Solana side, I'm building apps with DEX integration, and also learning about cross-chain tools to connect different blockchains.

In cybersecurity, Iâ€™ve worked on tools for network scanning, monitoring, and threat detection, using tools like Wireshark, Nmap, and custom scripts.

I'm passionate about creating systems that are open, secure, and owned by users.

I love football, chess and have a great interest in philosphy.

Here to learn and grow ...passionate about tech but surely there's a life outside it too... Connect and we can explore together
